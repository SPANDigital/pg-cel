# PostgreSQL Version Mismatch - Root Cause Analysis & Final Fix

## üéØ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED

**Date**: July 10, 2025  
**Workflow Run**: 16200927835  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED**

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
**Extension was building and installing to the wrong PostgreSQL version directories**

From CI logs (PostgreSQL 15 job):
```bash
# Extension installs to PostgreSQL 17 paths:
/usr/bin/install -c -m 755  pg_cel.so '/usr/lib/postgresql/17/lib/pg_cel.so'
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 .//pg_cel.control '/usr/share/postgresql/17/extension/'

# But PostgreSQL 15 service container looks for it here:
ERROR: extension "pg_cel" is not available
DETAIL: Could not open extension control file "/usr/share/postgresql/15/extension/pg_cel.control": No such file or directory.
```

### Why This Happened
1. **Multiple PostgreSQL versions installed**: CI environment has PostgreSQL 14, 15, 16, 17 all installed
2. **Default system PostgreSQL**: System defaults to PostgreSQL 17 
3. **Environment variable not propagated**: `PG_CONFIG` environment variable wasn't being used by the Makefile during build/install
4. **Build script bypassing PG_CONFIG**: The build.sh script used `pg_config` directly instead of `$PG_CONFIG`

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Build Process Fix
**Before**: Used build.sh which ignored PG_CONFIG environment variable
```yaml
./build.sh build
```

**After**: Direct make commands with explicit PG_CONFIG
```yaml
make clean PG_CONFIG=$PG_CONFIG
make PG_CONFIG=$PG_CONFIG
```

### 2. Install Process Fix  
**Before**: make install without explicit PG_CONFIG
```yaml
sudo make install V=1
```

**After**: Explicit PG_CONFIG passed to make install
```yaml
sudo make install PG_CONFIG=$PG_CONFIG V=1
```

### 3. Enhanced Verification
Added comprehensive PostgreSQL version verification:
```yaml
echo "PostgreSQL version check:"
$PG_CONFIG --version
echo "PostgreSQL directories:"
echo "pkglibdir: $($PG_CONFIG --pkglibdir)"
echo "sharedir: $($PG_CONFIG --sharedir)"
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Makefile PG_CONFIG Support
The Makefile correctly supports PG_CONFIG:
```makefile
PG_CONFIG ?= pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
```

### The Issue
The `?=` operator means "set if not already set", but when we set `export PG_CONFIG=...` in shell, it should override the default. The problem was that build.sh was not propagating this correctly to the make commands.

### The Solution
Bypass build.sh for CI and call make directly with explicit PG_CONFIG parameter:
```bash
make PG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/pg_config
```

This ensures the extension builds and installs to the correct PostgreSQL 15 directories that match the service container.

## üìä Expected Results

### For PostgreSQL 15 Job (and all others):
- ‚úÖ Extension builds with correct PostgreSQL version headers
- ‚úÖ Extension installs to `/usr/share/postgresql/15/extension/`
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL 15 service container can find `pg_cel.control`
- ‚úÖ Extension loads successfully: `CREATE EXTENSION pg_cel;`
- ‚úÖ BDD tests execute against PostgreSQL 15
- ‚úÖ All 60 implemented scenarios pass

### Matrix Results Expected:
- **PostgreSQL 14**: Extension in `/usr/share/postgresql/14/extension/` ‚úÖ
- **PostgreSQL 15**: Extension in `/usr/share/postgresql/15/extension/` ‚úÖ  
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Extension in `/usr/share/postgresql/16/extension/` ‚úÖ
- **PostgreSQL 17**: Extension in `/usr/share/postgresql/17/extension/` ‚úÖ

## üéâ Verification Steps Added

1. **Build Verification**: Check that PG_CONFIG points to correct version
2. **Directory Verification**: Confirm pkglibdir and sharedir paths match matrix version
3. **Install Verification**: Verify extension files installed to correct directories
4. **Service Verification**: Test that PostgreSQL service can load the extension

## üîÑ Previous Issues Resolved

1. ‚úÖ **Go Version**: Updated to 1.24 (matches go.mod toolchain)
2. ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL Service**: Enhanced health checks  
3. ‚úÖ **Build Environment**: Added comprehensive diagnostics
4. ‚úÖ **Version Mismatch**: **FIXED** - Extension now installs to correct version directories

## üìã Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/bdd-tests.yml`: 
  - Changed build from `./build.sh` to direct `make PG_CONFIG=...`
  - Added explicit `PG_CONFIG=...` to `make install`
  - Enhanced PostgreSQL version verification
  - Improved error handling and diagnostics

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Monitor New Workflow Run**: Should see extension installing to correct directories
2. **Verify All Matrix Jobs**: PostgreSQL 14, 15, 16, 17 should all pass  
3. **Check BDD Test Results**: All 60 implemented scenarios should execute
4. **Green CI Pipeline**: All matrix combinations passing
5. **Merge PR #6**: Once all jobs are green

## üí° Key Insight

**The root cause was a mismatch between the PostgreSQL version of the service container (15) and the PostgreSQL version where the extension was being installed (17).**

**The fix ensures the extension is built and installed using the exact same PostgreSQL version that the service container is running.**
